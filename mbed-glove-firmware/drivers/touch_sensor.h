 * Filename:  touch_sensor.h * Project:   EECS 473 - Team GLOVE
 * Date:      Fall 2016
 * Authors:

 *     Tim Schumacher
 *
 * Purpose: *   Top-level interface for working with capacitive sensor chip,
 *   which uses I2C and can communicate the values of up to 7 sensors
 *
 *   The AT42QT1070 in I2C comms mode can use a single interrupt line
 *   to indicate a change in state of the sensors.
 *
 * Usage: needs Thread and TouchSensor objects
 *   TouchSensor touch_sensor;
 *   Thread touch_sensor_thread;
 *   touch_sensor_thread.start(&touch_sensor, &TouchSensor::updateTask);
 *
 ************************
 *  NOTES
 *   Calibrate:
 *    - can send into "calibration cycle" with any non-zero value
 *
 *   Reset:
 *    - soft reset with any non-zero value
 *    - hard reset with minimum 5us pulse to reset line
